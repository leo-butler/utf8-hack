-*- mode: fundamental; coding: utf-8 -*-

Provide a Maxima top-level function, utf8_hack, that hacks the Maxima
parser to let non-utf8 aware Lisps to read (some) utf8-encoded Maxima
source files.

The hack works around the non-utf8 aware Lisps by interning the wide
characters as symbols and coercing the symbols to lists of (narrow)
characters. These narrow characters are used as hash keys
in *alpha-char-hash*, whose values are a list of conses of the form

("DESCRIPTION OF CHARACTER" . CHARACTER)

where the CDR is, of course, not the character per se, but the
character as an interned symbol.

The Maxima function `alphabetp' in src/nparse.lisp is modified to use
this hash table to verify if a character is alphabetical.

In the present configuration, utf8_hack admits only the Greek
alphabet (including accented characters) and all characters denoted as
mathematical. There is Emacs Lisp code in utf8-hack.lisp that allows
for the user to generate a wider or narrower default.

Finally, utf8_hack.lisp includes three Maxima top-level functions:

	--set_alpha_char (char_sym, description)

	Add a wide character, denoted by char_sym, to the hashtable of
       	known alphabetical characters. The char_sym may be a quoted
       	character, a symbol or an integer; description should be a
       	string.

        --utf8_hack(regexp):

	Regexp may be MAXIMA-NREGEX regular expression, `all' or
	empty. This function alters the range of accepted utf8
	characters by choosing only those whose description matches
	`regexp'.

	If `regexp' is `all', the default is restored; if `regexp' is
	empty (or `false'), then all non-ascii characters are made
	non-alphabetical.

	Examples:

		In (%i1), Maxima's parser flags an error due to the
		wide utf8 character. After loading utf8-hack.lisp, the
		parser parses (%i2) successfully.

		In (%i3), utf8_hack redefines the alphabetical
		characters to include only those extra characters that
		have "math" in the description. (%i4) shows that the
		parses treats the Greek characters as in the first
		line. The second (%i4) is the same line, but with
		mathematical rho and theta. In (%i5), we redefine the
		alphabetical characters to include only the extra
		Greek characters; in (%i6) we see the parser chokes on
		the mathematical characters, but reads the Greek
		characters successfully.

	--print_alpha_char_hash()

	Prints the current hash-table *alpha-char-hash*.

	WARNING: this is a HACK. Some wide characters will be

	included. You have been warned.
